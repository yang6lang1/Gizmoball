Java game Gizmoball - MIT Opencourseware EE6.170 course project

This article contains a list of unfinished tasks(not complete)

Unimplemented functionality:
Game components:
-Gizmos: 
1. leftFlipper: x,y, color, length, angularVelocity(need some calculation here...), rotate() function
2. rightFlipper: same as leftFlipper
3. absorber: Need to decide the most user-friendly way to insert an absorber. Where to shoot the ball? Should the ball be shot out when user press "space" key?
4. ball:A lot of things need to be modified. The game physics should be implemented into move() and related methods

-Key bindings:
1. move(press m enters moveMode), delete(ctrl+D), rotate(ctrl+R), connect


This article contains a list of unfinished tasks(not complete)

Unimplemented functionality:
Game components:
-Gizmos: 
1. leftFlipper: x,y, color, 2Lx2L, angularVelocity(need some calculation here...),resetTime,activationDelay, rotate() function
2. rightFlipper: same as leftFlipper
3. absorber: Need to decide the most user-friendly way to insert an absorber. Where to shoot the ball? Should the ball be shot out when user press "space" key?
4. ball:A lot of things need to be modified. The game physics should be implemented into move() and related methods
--------------------------------------

-Key bindings:
--gridPanel(Build Mode)
1. pre-condition: the gizmo needs to be selected(The 'isSelected' in gridPanel is set to true):
move(press m enters moveMode), delete(ctrl+D), rotate(ctrl+R), connect(I don'g really know what key should i bind to this..)

2. Press ESC should quit the current mode.
Eg: if the gridPanel is in isSelect mode and moveMode, press ESC once quit the moveMode, press again quit the isSelected mode
Important: Update the animation on screen such as color change and update the back-end such as tempBuffer clearing, isSelect boolean
reinitialize, etc....

3. Mouse click(MouseListener): this has been implemented.. Need to test....

--animationWindow(Game Mode)
coming soon...
**************************************

Buttons and Menu Items:
-menu

-buttons

-popupAlert

-contextMenu(right click)
--leftFlipper,rightFlipper:
1.property(change the physical property of the gizmo): coeffiectOfRebound; resetTime; angularVelocity; antivationDelay
